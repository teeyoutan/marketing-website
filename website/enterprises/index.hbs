        <blockquote>
            <p>Most people on our team found it hard to believe that a single word could really have a meaningful impact on user behavior. Prior to Optimizely, testing
      usually meant more people needed to be involved, which made for a longer process, and didn't typically allow for a quick and easy test; it didn't take more
      than a day to discover that the naysayers were totally wrong.</p>
