INTEGRATION


Joint Lotame DMP and Optimizely clients will have a unique combination of innovative DMP and website optimization tools that they can use to easily satisfy consumer demand for rich, relevant and personalized content.
 
Through the partnership, Lotame will integrate its rich audience data segments with Optimizely’s A/B and multivariate testing platform that delivers actionable insights into visitor behavior.  This data allows customers to define Optimizely Audiences, which in turn, allow customers to analyze their results and target their experiments by otherwise unavailable attributes.
