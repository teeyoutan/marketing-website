COMPANY

Delacon has extensive expertise in developing leading edge telecommunication technologies including a world class call tracking solution.

INTEGRATION

Delacon’s team have devised a unique method to analyze call data from split tested pages within Optimizely. When combining the data from telephone calls and submission form clicks, companies will be able to make fully informed decisions based on all available data. The call data is captured by adding extra tracking code to each variation and creating an Optimizely custom event goal. In addition to Optimizely, call data can be analysed in Delacon's reports and Google Analytics.
