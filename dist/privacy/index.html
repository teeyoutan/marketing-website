        <h4 id="information-we-collect" class="padding-top">Information We Collect</h4>

        <p><strong>Our Service:</strong> We may collect personally identifiable information about you through our Service when you register for an account, such as your email address. If you choose to purchase a product from us, we or our third-party payment processors will collect your payment information also. We also collect data through our partners (customers) who use our Service (including by embedding our code on their websites) to analyze usage of their websites. When you use our Service or if you visit such websites, your browser may send us certain information about you as described below.

If you no longer wish to receive these emails, you may opt out of them by canceling your account.</p>

        <p><strong>Cookies Information:</strong> We may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets us learn about your behavior and usage patterns when you are on our Service. A cookie may also convey anonymous information about how you browse a partner website to us. A cookie does not collect personal information about you. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser's directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.</p>

        <p><strong>Third Party Cookies:</strong> Our partners, affiliates, and service providers use cookies to: (a) monitor the effectiveness of our Service and the offerings of our partners; (b) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns; (c) diagnose or fix technology problems; (d) and allow our business partners to deliver advertisements to you as described below. The use of cookies by our partners, affiliates and service providers are not covered by our privacy policy. We do have access and control over the use of these cookies on our site.</p>

        <p><strong>Log File Information:</strong> Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page on our Service. When you access the Service, our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.</p>

        <p><strong>Clear Gifs Information:</strong> When you access the Service, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our Users anonymously. No personally identifiable information from your Optimizely account is collected using these clear gifs. The information is used to enable more accurate reporting, improve the effectiveness of our Service, and make Optimizely better for our Users and partners.</p>

We may store personal information in locations outside the direct control of Optimizely (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers). Any personally identifiable information you elect to make publically available on the Service, such as posting comments on our blog page, will be available to other Users. If you remove information that you have made public on the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, or if other Users have copied or saved that information. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at support@optimizely.com.  In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p>

        <p><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information:</strong> We may share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to help them understand the usage patterns for certain Optimizely services and those of our partners. Our partners also have the option to publish the A/B testing results for their websites on the Service. Such results consist solely of non-personally identifiable information. If you choose to publish such results on our Service (for example, in our Results Gallery), you understand and agree that this information, along with any personally identifiable information you choose to make available in connection with such results, will be made publically available. By publishing your results on the Optimizely Service, you agree that you have obtained all necessary consents to make such information public and that doing so will not violate any laws.

        <p><strong>Instances where we are required to share your information:</strong> Optimizely will disclose your information where required to do so by law or subpoena or if we reasonably believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement; (b) to enforce our Terms of Service or to protect the security or integrity of our Service; and/or (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Optimizely, our Users or others.</p>

        <p><strong>What happens in the event of a change of control:</strong> We may buy or sell/divest/transfer the company (including any shares in the company), or any combination of its products, services, assets and/or businesses. Your information such as customer names and email addresses, and other User information related to the Service may be among the items sold or otherwise transferred in these types of transactions.

        <p><strong>Ads:</strong> We use Remarketing with Google Analytics to advertise online. In connection with this advertising, we, along with third-party business partners, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) to allow our third-party business partners, including Google, ad servers, and ad networks, to serve you advertisements (“ads”) based on your prior visits to our Service. These ads are delivered to you on third-party websites and services across the Internet. These third-party business partners use technology to send, directly to your browser or mobile device, the ads and ad links that appear on third-party sites, and will automatically receive your IP address when they do so. Along with cookies, they may also use other technologies (such as JavaScript, device identifiers, location data, and clear gifs, see above) to compile information about your browser’s or device’s visits and usage patterns on the Service, and to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to optimize and personalize the advertising content. Optimizely does not sell, rent, or share the information we collect directly from you or about you from third parties with these third-party business partners for such parties’ own marketing purposes. You may opt out of the DoubleClick cookie by visiting the Google advertising opt-out page or you may opt out of Google Analytics by visiting the Google Analytics opt-out page. Google has additional information available about their Remarketing Privacy Guidelines, Policies, and Restrictions.</p>

        <p>Your information collected through the Service may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Optimizely or its subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities. Optimizely may transfer information that we collect about you, including personal information, to affiliated entities, or to other third parties across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction, and you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. or any other country in which Optimizely or its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h4 id="how-we-protect-your-information" class="padding-top">How We Protect Your Information</h4>

        <p>Optimizely is concerned with protecting your privacy and data, but we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Optimizely or guarantee that your information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our industry standard physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:support@optimizely.com" target="_blank">support@optimizely.com</a>.</p>

        <p>We use an outside help platform, and a credit card processing company to bill you if you purchase services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.</p>
